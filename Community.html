	<li>Gardening was something that I was intrigued of so for most of my service hours I always wanted to do something that involved nature or gardening.</li>
	<li>Some of the things that I did in gardening are: Mulching - It is applying organic matter to the soil so that it will conserve the moisture and it helps to prevent weeds</li>
	<li>I also plucked out weeds which were growing, sometimes for the big weeds I would use tools so that it is properly removed but most of the times it is done by hand.</li>
	<li>Mowing is something I did for most of neighbors, mowing taught me to be patient. Mowing helped me with my physical exercise and it helped me better connect to the nature.</li>
	<li>Engaging in these activities help improve my environmental awareness. These experiences have made me a person who appreciates nature and values the importance of hard work.</li>
	<li>Some other services that I did to improve my commuinty were tutoring students who had difficuty in mostly math and also cleaning up trash on my school campus with my friends.</li>
